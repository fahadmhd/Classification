## Classification model using Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors 

### Classification model using Decision Tree
We use classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

### K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm. Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification. To predict the class of a given data point, it takes into account the classes of the 'K' nearest data points and chooses the class in which the majority of the 'K' nearest data points belong to as the predicted class.
In the second notebook, we load a customer dataset, fit the data, and use K-Nearest Neighbors to predict a data point.
